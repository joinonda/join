    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

    <h3>1. General information</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data when you use the student project
      “Join”. The project was developed as part of a web development bootcamp at the
      <span class="da-span"> Developer Akademie GmbH</span> and is used solely for educational
      purposes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="controller">2. Data controller</h3>
    <p>
      The responsible persons (“we”) are the listed students in the
      <a href="#legalnotice">Legal Notice</a>. For any privacy-related questions, please contact:
      <br />
      Email: [Contact Email Placeholder]
    </p>

    <h3>3. Purpose of data processing</h3>
    <p>
      We process personal data to provide account registration and login, to store user-created
      content, and to ensure security and proper operation of the Service. We do not use your data
      for advertising or analytics.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Categories of data processed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account data:</strong> name, email address, password (stored as a secure hash via
        Firebase Authentication)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App data:</strong> information you create or submit in the app (e.g., tasks,
        comments)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, browser type, access times, and error logs for
        security purposes
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Legal bases</h3>
    <p>
      Processing is based on:
      <br />
      <strong>Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR</strong> (performance of a contract) – to provide login and core app
      functionality;
      <br />
      <strong>Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR</strong> (legitimate interest) – to maintain security, prevent
      abuse, and ensure stability.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Firebase (Google) services</h3>
    <p>
      We use Firebase, a platform provided by Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View,
      CA 94043, USA) and operated for EEA customers by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
      Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Firebase acts as our data processor.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>: manages user registration, login, and password
        reset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong>: stores user data such as tasks or entries
        created within the app.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Data is generally stored in Firebase servers located in the EU region (<em>europe-west</em>).
      Google may process data in third countries; in such cases, appropriate safeguards such as EU
      Standard Contractual Clauses are applied.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Data sharing</h3>
    <p>
      Apart from Firebase (Google) as our data processor, we do not share personal data with third
      parties. We do not sell or rent your personal data.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Data retention and deletion</h3>
    <p>
      Your account data and stored app data remain in our Firebase project for as long as your
      account exists. If you delete your account or request deletion, the associated data will be
      erased or anonymised. Technical logs are retained only for a short time for security reasons.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Cookies and tracking</h3>
    <p>
      Join does not use cookies, analytics, or tracking technologies. Firebase Authentication may
      use temporary cookies or tokens to maintain login sessions; these are technically necessary.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Your rights under the GDPR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise your rights or for any data protection concerns, please contact us via the email
      provided above.
    </p>

    <h3>11. Security</h3>
    <p>
      We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data. All
      passwords are securely stored using Firebase Authentication’s built-in encryption. However, no
      system is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h3>12. Changes to this policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary to reflect technical or legal developments.
      The latest version is always available within the Join project.
