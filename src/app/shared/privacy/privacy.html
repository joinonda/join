    <h3>1. General information</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data when you use the student project
      “Join”. The project was developed as part of a web development bootcamp at the
      <strong>Developer Akademie GmbH</strong> and is used solely for educational purposes.

    <h3>2. Data controller</h3>

      The responsible persons (“we”) are the listed students in the
      <a href="#imprint">Legal Notice</a>. For any privacy-related questions, please contact:

    </p>

    <h3>3. Purpose of data processing</h3>
    <p>
      “Join” is a demonstration project. We do not operate a commercial service and do not collect
      personal data for business or marketing purposes. Any data processed (such as names or email
      addresses entered voluntarily within the app) is used only to demonstrate the app’s
      functionality locally or temporarily on a demo server.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Categories of data processed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Voluntary input data such as name, email, or task information</li>
      <li>
        Technical data such as browser type, time of access, or IP address (transmitted
        automatically and possibly stored temporarily in server logs)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Legal basis</h3>
    <p>
      Processing of data is based on <strong>Art. 6 (1) f GDPR</strong> (legitimate interest) for
      ensuring technical functionality and user interaction within the educational context. Any
      voluntarily entered personal data is processed based on
      <strong>Art. 6 (1) a GDPR</strong> (consent).
    </p>

    <h3>6. Data storage and deletion</h3>
    <p>
      Any personal data entered in Join is stored only temporarily during your active use of the
      application and is deleted automatically when the project or browser session ends. We do not
      maintain a permanent database or user accounts.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Data sharing</h3>
    <p>
      We do not share personal data with third parties. The project may be hosted on educational or
      personal web servers (e.g., GitHub Pages, Firebase, or Developer Akademie servers). In such
      cases, hosting providers may process technical log data under data processing agreements in
      compliance with Art. 28 GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Cookies and analytics</h3>
    <p>
      Join does not use cookies, analytics tools, or tracking technologies for advertising or
      profiling. Your browser may store technical session information necessary for functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Your rights under the GDPR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Right to access your personal data (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>

    </p>

    <h3>10. Security</h3>
    <p>
      We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure your data against
      unauthorised access or loss. However, since Join is a non-commercial educational project, no
      continuous server-side protection or encryption of user data can be guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h3>11. Changes to this policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary to reflect technical changes or legal
      requirements. The current version will always be available within the Join project.
