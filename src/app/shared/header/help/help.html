    <h3>What is Join?</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="join-span">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
      built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the
      <span class="join-span"> Developer Akademie</span>. <br /><br />
      Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
      limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
      <span class="join-span">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage
      their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br /><br />

          <p>Exploring the Board</p>
          <p>
            When you log in to <span class="join-span">Join</span>, you'll find a default board.
            This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In
            Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to-use-it-single" role="listitem">
        <div>
          <span class="how-to-use-it-span">2.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="how-to-use-it-p">
          <p>Creating Contacts</p>
          <p>
            In <span class="join-span">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
            projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
            information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
            the tasks on the board.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to-use-it-single" role="listitem">
        <div>
          <span class="how-to-use-it-span">3.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="how-to-use-it-p">
          <p>Adding Cards</p>
          <p>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
            individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card.
            Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
            etc.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to-use-it-single" role="listitem">
        <div>
          <span class="how-to-use-it-span">4.</span>

        <div class="how-to-use-it-p">
          <p>Moving Cards</p>
          <p>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
            dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
          </p>

          <p>Deleting Cards</p>
          <p>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
            Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when
            deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. Remember that using Join effectively
            requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
            current state of your project. Have more questions about
